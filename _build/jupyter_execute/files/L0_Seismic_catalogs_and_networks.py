# From this list, we can learn that all the channels convert the ground velocity (m/s) into integers (counts), but for the channels HN* which instead convert the ground acceleration (m/s$^2$) into integers (counts). We thus understand that the instrument codes H and N (the second letter) stand for velocimeters (or high gain seismometer, NANOMETRICS TRILLIUM-40S) and accelerometers (KINEMETRICS EPISENSOR-FBA-ES-T-CL-1G-FS-40-VPP), respectively. 
# 
# As it concerns the channels of the velocimeters, we can see that they are characterized by different band codes (B,H,L,V), each of which with different sampling rates. These channels comes from the same sensor (NANOMETRICS TRILLIUM-40S) and they are provided for different purposes, depending on the frequency range on which we are interested. For seismological applications, we shall select the chahnels with the highest sampling rate that, for this velocimeters, are the channels HH*.
# 
# In {numref}`Section %s - Seismometers <sec-seismometer>` we will better discuss how modern seismometers work and why they record *counts* rather than the relative motion as discussed in {numref}`Lecture %s - Harmonic oscillator <chap-H>`.

# (sec-seismometer)=
# ## Seismometers
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# A seismic station (or seismograph) consists of a sensor (seismometer),
# an analog to digital converter (digitizer) and the recorder. The
# seismometer converts the ground motion (input) into another continuous
# physical signal, like a voltage (or the motion of the stylos drawing on
# a sheet of paper). The digitizer converts the output signal from the
# sensor into a number called *count*, just like we do with a digital voltmeter.
# The digitizer is characterized by the resolution (how we discretize the
# continuous voltage into *counts*) and the sampling rate
# (how many *counts* per second). In the end, the recorder stores the
# *counts* from the ditigitizer into flash memories or hard disks.
# 
# Sensors are divided into passive and active sensors. A (modern) passive
# seismometer mainly consists of a spring-mass system and a coil embedded
# into a magnetic field that both damps the motion of the mass with
# respect to the seismometer and outputs a voltage which is nearly
# proportional to the ground velocity above the natural frequency of the
# spring-mass system (typically of the order of 1 Hz, although it
# can be as low as 0.03 Hz). It thus can be seen as a velocity
# transducer. Older passive seismometers, instead, simply consist of a
# spring-mass system in series with a dash pot (usually filled with oil)
# and measure the displacement of the mass through a stylus drawing on a
# sheet of paper or some other optical devices. An active seismometer, like the
# force balanced accelerometers (FBA), adds a displacement transducer
# (i.e., a capacitor whose capacitance varies with the displacement of the
# mass) that sends, in a negative feedback loop, a current to the coil
# which exerts a force equal and opposite to the inertia force in order to
# prevent the mass from moving at all with respect to the seismometer.
# This current, being proportional to the ground acceleration in a large
# frequency band, gives a direct measure of it.
# 
# Passive seismometers, although less accurate than the active ones, are
# cheaper and simpler to be installed into the field. 
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Velocimeters
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# A modern passive seismometer (or digital velocimeter) can be obtained using a mechanical seismometer and converting 
# the relative motion of the mass into a current through a magnetic field and a coil. 
# This current can also be used to damp the relative motion of the mass. In this case, the output 
# of the seismometer is a voltage, $V$, proportional to the relative velocity 
# of the mass with respect to the seismometer, $\dot{z}$,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# &V(t) = G\,\dot{z}(t)
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# with $G$ being the generator constant.
# The voltage is then converted into $n$ bits (typically 24), or counts, by the
# digitizer and stored into the recorder
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & c(t) = C\,V(t)  
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# The digitizer has $2^n$ ($\approx 1.7\times10^{7}$) levels that, once
# subdivided into positive and negatives levels, correspond to a dynamic
# range from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$
# ($\approx \pm 8.4\times10^{6}$). In this respect, assuming a voltage range $[-V_\mathrm{max},V_\mathrm{max}]$, the constant $C$ reads
# 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & C = \frac{2^{n-1}}{V_\mathrm{max}}
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# Depending on the generatot constant and on the voltage range of the voltmeter, a modern passive seismometer can be subdivides into high and low gain seismometers. High gain seismometers finely discretize a small voltage ranges, thus being accurate but prone to saturation. Low-gain seismometers, instead, are set in such a way that the voltage ranges is wide and, so, they hardly reach the saturation but they are less accurate than high-gain seismometers. The latter are use for strong ground motion applications, i.e., for studying seismic waves in proximity of the epicenter. High-gain seismometers, instead, can be used to studying teleseismic waves, far from the epicenter.
# 
# By considering the response function, as defined in  {numref}`Lecture %s <chap-H>` - {ref}`chap-H` and  {numref}`Lecture %s <chap-F>` - {ref}`chap-F`, and the fact that the output of the velocimeters is in counts, we can write the following relation between the Fourier transform of the counts and the ground velocity 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# \tilde{c}(\omega) = C\,G\,\big(i\,\omega\,\tilde{z}(\omega)\big) = C\,G\,\tilde{R}(\omega)\,(i\,\omega\,\tilde{u}_g(\omega)\big)
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# In this respect, the response function of seismometers differs by that of an harmonic oscillator only by the factor $C\,G$, that is the so called *instrument sensitivity*.
# 
# ```
#
