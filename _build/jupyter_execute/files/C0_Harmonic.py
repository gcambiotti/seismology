# ## Driven harmonic oscillators
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# The driven harmonic oscillator is an useful tool in seismology because it can be used for describing either a simple mechanical seismometer or  the deformation of a building when they are subjected to ground motion.
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Seismometer

# Cartoon depicting a seismometer at rest and driven by ground motion (left and right pannels) and the absolute and reference systems.
# ```
# 
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Let us consider a seismometer composed by an probe mass attached to a spring and embedded in a viscous dashpot as depicted in {numref}`Figure {number} <fig-seismometer>`. Let us denote with $h_0$ the height of the probe mass at rest and consider the absolute coordinate of the probe mass $u$ as the sum of the ground motion $u_g$, the height at rest $h_0$ and its relative motion with respect to it $z$
# 
# $$
# u(t) = u_g(t) + h_0 + z(t)
# $$ (H0:1)
# 
# The elastic, $F_e$, and anaelastic, $F_a$, forces acting on the probe mass will be given by 
# 
# $$
# F_e=-k\,z \qquad F_a =-c\,\dot{z}
# $$ (H0:2)
# 
# From the second Newton's law
# 
# $$
# F_e+F_a = m\,\ddot{u}
# $$ (H0:3)
# 
# declined in the case of a machanical seismometer as the one depicted in figure (??), we thus obtain the following differential equation
# 
# $$
# -k\,z(t) - c\,\dot{z}(t) = m\,\big(\ddot{u}_g(t)+\ddot{z}(t)\big)
# $$ (H0:4)
# 
# where $m$ is the probe mass, $k$ is the elastic constant of the spring and $c$ is the anaelastic friction. We note that the left hand side is the sum of the total forces acting on the probe mass while the right-hand side is the inertial force, i.e., the mass by its total acceleration. 
# 
# By dividing eq. {eq}`H0:4` by the mass $m$ and defining the natural angular frequency $\omega_0$ and the damping ratio $\xi$ as follows
# 
# $$
# \omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \qquad \xi = \frac{c}{2\,\omega_0}
# $$ (H0:5)
# 
# we obtain
# 
# $$
# \ddot{z}(t) + 2\,\omega_0\,\xi\,\dot{z}(t) + \omega_0^2\,z(t) = -\ddot{u}_g(t)
# $$ (H0:6)
# 
# that is the classical form of a driven harmonic oscillator, where the left-hand side describes a damped harmonic oscilator and the right-hand side is the driving term that, in the present case, corresponds to minus the ground acceleration.
# 
# In the following we will also make use of the natural period of the harmonic oscillator, which is simply given by
# 
# $$
# T_0 =  \frac{2\,\pi}{\omega_0} = 2\,\pi\, \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
# $$ (H0:7)

# ### Building

# ```{figure} ../images/Building.png

# Cartoon depicting a building at rest and driven by ground motion (left and right pannels) and the absolute and reference systems.
# ```
# 
# 
# 
# ````{div} full-width
# 
# Let su consider a building and, as depicted in {numref}`Figure {number} <fig-building>`, denote with $u$ the absolute coordinate of its top, which can be seen as the sum of the ground motion (i.e., at the bottom of the building) and the building height $h$
# 
# $$
# u(t) = u_g(t) + h(t) 
# $$ (H0:8)
# 
# Due to deformation of the building $h$ will vary with time and so we also write $h$ as the sum of its height at rest $h_0$ and its relative displacement $z$
# 
# $$
# h(t) = h_0 + z(t)
# $$ (H0:9)
# 
# The ratio $z/h_0$ can be seen as a measure of the internal strain and, so, the elastic and anaelastic forces will be proportional to $z$ and its time derivative $\dot{z}$, respectively
# 
# $$
# F_e = -\frac{\mu\,z}{h_0}
# \qquad
# F_a = -\frac{\eta\,\dot{z}}{h_0}
# $$ (H0:10)
# 
# with $\mu$ and $\eta$ being the elastic modulus and effective viscosity of the building. In thi respect, from the comparison with eq. {eq}`H0:2`, the elastic constant and anaelastic friction of the building are inversely proportional to the building height: $c\propto h_0^{-1}$ and $c\propto h_0^{-1}$.
# 
# Similar to the seismometer, from the second Newton's law, we thus can write 
# 
# $$
# -k\,z(t) - c\,\dot{z}(t) = m\,\big(\ddot{u}_g(t)+\ddot{z}(t)\big)
# $$ (H0:11)
# 
# and recast it in the form of the driven harmonic oscillator
# 
# $$
# \ddot{z}(t) + 2\,\omega_0\,\xi\,\dot{z}(t) + \omega_0^2\,z(t) = -\ddot{u}_g(t)
# $$ (H0:12)
# 
# 
# ```{admonition} The natural period of buildings
# :class: note
# 
# As a rule of thumb, we note that the the natural period of building is roughly propotional to the the number of floors $n$ in the building. Indeed, considering $h_0=n\,\Delta h$ anmd $m=n\,\Delta m$ with $\Delta h$ and $\Delta m$ being the height and the mass of each floors, we obtain
# 
# $$
# T_0 = 2\,\pi\,\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} = n\,\delta T
# $$ (H0:13)
# 
# with $\delta T$ being the natural period of each floor
# 
# $$
# \delta T=2\,\pi\,\sqrt{\frac{\delta m}{\delta h}}
# $$ (H0:14)
# 
# In contrast, it can checked that the damping ratio $\xi$ does not vary with the number of floors and it usually ranges from $0.05$ to $0.1$ (or, in the woording of the  engineers, from $5\%$ to $10%$).
# 
# ```
# 
# 
# 
# ```{admonition} Relative or total acceleration?
# :class: note
# 
# As shown by eqs. {eq}`H0:6` and {eq}`H0:12`, both the relative motion of the seismometer and of the building are governed by the same differential equation, having the minus ground acceleration as the driven term. When we will discuss the seismometer, we will focus on the link betweem the ground and the relative motions as the former and the latter are what we want retrive and can measure, respectively. When we will discuss the building, instead, we will be more interested in quantifying the total acceleration to which it is subjected, and we will recover it as the sum of the ground and relative acceleration.

# ## Damped Harmonic oscillator
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# The damped harmonic oscillator is a classic problem in mechanics. It describes the movement of a mechanical oscillator (e.g. spring pendulum) under the influence of a restoring force and friction. Let us thus set to zero the ground motion acceletarion and solve the homogenous differential equation with specified initial condition on the position and velocity at time = $t=0$
# 
# $$
# \ddot{z}_\mathrm{h}(t) + 2\,\omega_0\,\xi\,\dot{z}_\mathrm{h}(t) + \omega_0^2\,z_\mathrm{h}(t) = 0
# $$
# $$
# z_\mathrm{h}(0) = u_0
# \qquad
# \dot{z}_\mathrm{h}(0) = v_0
# $$ (H0:15)
# 
# 
# The homogeneous solution can be found starting from this trial form
# 
# $$
# z_\mathrm{h}(t) = Z_+\,e^{\gamma_+\,t} + Z_-\,e^{\gamma_-\,t}
# $$ (H0:16)
# 
# and it is straigforwad to show that the two exponents $\gamma_\pm$ are the solution of a degree-2 polynomial 
# 
# $$
# Z_\pm\,\big(\gamma_\pm^2+2\,\omega_0\,\xi\,\gamma_\pm + \omega_0\big)\,e^{\gamma_\pm\,t} = 0
# $$ (H0:17)
# 
# and read
# 
# $$
# \gamma_\pm = -\omega_0\,\xi \pm \omega_0\,\sqrt{\xi^2-1}
# $$ (H0:18)
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Underdamped harmonic oscillator
# 
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Within the assumption that $\xi<1$, the square root in the right-hand side of eq. {eq}`H0:18` is imaginary and the two exponents can be rewritten as folllows
# 
# $$
# \gamma_\pm = -\lambda \pm i\,\omega_d
# $$ (H0:19)
# 
# with
# 
# $$
# \lambda = \omega_0\,\xi \qquad
# \omega_d = \omega_0\,\sqrt{1-\xi^2}
# $$ (H0:20)
# 
# In view of the fact that the real parts of the two exponents coincide, we can recast eq. {eq}`H0:16` as follows
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# z_\mathrm{h}(t) &= \big(Z_+\,e^{i\,\omega_d\,t} + Z_-\,e^{-i\,\omega_d\,t}\big)\,e^{-\lambda\,t} \\
#                 &= \big(C\,\cos(\omega_d\,t) + S\,\sin(\omega_d\,t)\big)\,e^{-\lambda\,t}
# \end{align}
# $$ (H0:21)
# 
# where $C$ and $S$ are two constants of integration related to the former by
# 
# $$
# C = Z_+ + Z_-   \qquad
# S=i\,\big(Z_+ - Z_-\big)
# $$ (H0:22)
# 
# In light of this, the assumption of  $\xi<1$ leads to underdamped oscillations: the system oscillates (with a slightly different frequency than the natural frequency) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero. The angular frequency of the underdamped harmonic oscillator is $\omega_d$  and the exponential decay of the underdamped harmonic oscillator is $\lambda$. In light of this, the homogeneous solution of the harmonic oscillator can be seen as a transient response with an exponential decay.
# 
# The cases $\xi=1$ and $\xi>1$, instead, describe critical and overdamped oscillations. They are not relevant in seismology and we do not discuss them.
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Initial conditions
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Considering the first order derivative of eq. {eq}`H0:21`
# 
# $$
# \dot{z}_\mathrm{h}(t) = \big[-(C\,\omega_d+S\,\lambda)\,\sin(\omega_d\,t) + (S\,\omega_d-C\,\lambda)\,\cos(\omega_d\,t)\big]\,e^{-\lambda\,t} 
# $$ (H0:23)
# 
# from eq. {eq}`H0:15` we have 
# 
# $$
# z_\mathrm{h}(0)  = C  = u_0
# \qquad \dot{z}_\mathrm{h}(0)  = S\,\omega_d - C\,\lambda  = v_0
# $$ (H0:24)
# 
# This system of equations is solved by
# 
# $$
# C = u_0 \qquad 
# S = \frac{u_0\,\lambda + v_0}{\omega_d} 
# $$ (H0:25)
# 
# 
# and the transient response, eq. {eq}`H0:21`, and its derivatives become
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & z_\mathrm{h}(t) = \left(u_0\,\cos(\omega_d\,t) +\frac{u_0\,\lambda  + v_0}{\omega_d}  \,\sin(\omega_d\,t)\right)\,e^{-\lambda\,t}
# \\
# & \dot{z}_\mathrm{h}(t) = \left(v_0  \,\cos(\omega_d\,t) - \frac{u_0\,\omega_0^2  + v_0\,\lambda}{\omega_d}\,\sin(\omega_d\,t)\right)\,e^{-\lambda\,t}
# \\
# &\ddot{z}_\mathrm{h}(t) = \left[a_0\,\,\cos(\omega_d\,t)-\frac{v_0\,\omega_0^2 + a_0\,\lambda }{\omega_d}  \,\sin(\omega_d\,t)\right]\,e^{-\lambda\,t}
# \end{align}
# $$ (H0:26)
# 
# with $a_0$ being the initial acceleration

# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# In view of the fact that the differential equation of the driven harmonic oscillator is linear in both $z$ and $u$ and their derivatives, its general solution, for any ground acceleration, can be expressed in the following form of a time convolution 
# 
# $$
# z(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \ddot{u}_g(\tau)\,G(t-\tau)\,d\tau
# $$ (H0:28)
# 
# between the ground acceleration and a Green function $G$ that we are going to determine.
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Green function
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Substituting eq. {eq}`H0:28` into eq. {eq}`H0:6` or {eq}`H0:12` we obtain
# 
# $$
# \int_{-\infty}^\infty \ddot{u}_g(\tau)\,\big(\ddot{G}(t-\tau)+2\,\lambda\,\dot{G}(t-\tau)+\omega_0^2\,G(t-\tau)\big)\,d\tau = -\ddot{u}_g(t)
# $$ (H0:29)
# 
# From this point of view, we can understand that we are looking for a Green function $G$ such that
# 
# $$
# \ddot{G}(t)+2\,\lambda\,\dot{G}(t)+\omega_0^2\,G(t) = - \delta(t)
# $$ (H0:30)
# 
# In this perspective, we test the following trial solution
# 
# $$
# G(t) = f(t)\,H(t)
# $$ (H0:31)
# 
# with $f$ satisfying the following initial conditions
# 
# $$
# f(0) = 0 \qquad \dot{f}(0) = -1
# $$ (H0:32)
# 
# These initial conditions have been defined in such a way that
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & \dot{G}(t) = \dot{f}(t)\,H(t) + f(0)\,\delta(t) =  \dot{f}(t)\,H(t)
# \\
# & \ddot{G}(t) = \ddot{f}(t)\,H(t) + \dot{f}(0)\,\delta(t) = \ddot{f}(t)\,H(t) -\delta(t)  
# \end{align}
# $$ (H0:33)
# 
# and, so, eq. {eq}`H0:30` simplifies into 
# 
# $$
# \big(\ddot{f}(t)+2\,\lambda\,\dot{f}(t)+\omega_0^2\,f(t)\big)\,H(t) = 0
# $$ (H0:34)
# 
# In this respect, $f$ is the homoegenous solution for the harmonic oscillator with initial conditions given by eq. {eq}`H0:32`. From eq. {eq}`H0:26` we thus obtain
# 
# $$
# f(t) = -\frac{\sin(\omega_d\,t)\,e^{-\lambda\,t}}{\omega_d}
# $$ (H0:35)
# 
# and the Green function becomes
# 
# $$
# G(t) = -\frac{\sin(\omega_d\,t)\,e^{-\lambda\,t}}{\omega_d}\,H(t)
# $$ (H0:35bis)
# ```
# 
# ### Response function
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# Starting from the Green function, eqs. {eq}`H0:31` and {eq}`H0:35`, we can also obtain the response function $R$ relating the ground and relative accelerations
# 
# $$
# \ddot{z}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \ddot{u}_g(\tau)\,\ddot{G}(t-\tau)\,d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \ddot{u}_g(\tau)\,R(t-\tau)\,d\tau
# $$ (H0:36)
# 
# that is the second order derivative of $G$
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# R(t) &= \ddot{G}(t) = \ddot{f}(t)\,H(t) -\delta(t)
# \\
# &= \left[ \frac{\omega_d^2-\lambda^2}{\omega_d}\,\sin(\omega_d\,t) +2\,\lambda\,\cos(\omega_d\,t)\right]\,e^{-\lambda\,t}\,H(t) - \delta(t)
# \end{align}
# $$ (H0:37)
# 
# It is straightforward to show that the response function also relates the ground and relative displacements, as well as the ground and relative velocities
# 
# 
# $$
# z(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u_g(\tau)\,R(t-\tau)\,d\tau
# \qquad
# \dot{z}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \dot{u}_g(\tau)\,R(t-\tau)\,d\tau
# $$ (H0:38)
# 
# Although the Green and response functions allow to determine the relative ground motion, their application requires a time convolution that can be tedious to be computed analytically and hide the physical understanding of the problem. We will use them in the frequency domain after {ref}`chap-F` and to make practise on the {ref}`chap-D`.
