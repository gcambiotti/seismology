# In this lesson, we will locate the origin of the 24/8/2016 M=6 Accumoli earthquake by exploiting the pickings of the first arrivals of the P and S waves obtained from the waveforms meeasured by a set of seismic station in the surrouning of the earthquake. In particular, our goal is to estimate the origin time, longitude, latitude and depth of the earthquake and to estimate the uncertainty of these estimates as well. 
# 
# In doing it, we will need a velocity model in order to modelling the several paths of the P and S waves from the hypocenter to the seismic stations and quantify the travel times. In particular, we will adopt the same velocity model used by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia for locating most of the earthquakes occurred in Italy. It is composed by the upper and lower crusts and the lithospheric mantle. The Conrad (between the upper and lower crusts) and Moho (between the lower crust and the lithospheric mantle) are set at 11 and 26.9 km depth.

# ## Inverse problem theory
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# We now rewiev the minimal aspects ot the inverse problem thoery that we need for estimating the origin time and spatial coordinates of an earthquake. More details about this topic can be found in {numref}`Appendix %s - Inverse problem theory <chap-I>`, including the difference between volumetric and density probability functions and how taking into account modelling errors.  
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Observation equation
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Let us write the so called observation equation
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & y = f(m) + \varepsilon 
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:1)
# 
# where $f$ is the function expressing the theoretical relationship between the model parameters $m$ and the observations $y$, and $\varepsilon$ are the random errors that we assume to obey to a (N-dimensional) Gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance $\mathrm{C}$
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(\varepsilon) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\,\pi)^N\,\det(C)}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{\varepsilon^T\,C^{-1}\,\varepsilon}{2}\right) 
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:2)
# 
# In particular, $y$, $\varepsilon$ and $m$ are the arrays collecting the $N$ observations $y_i$, the $N$ random errors $\varepsilon_i$ and the $M$ model parameters $m_i$
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & y = \big(y_1,\cdots,y_N\big) \qquad \varepsilon = \big(\varepsilon_1,\cdots,\varepsilon_N\big) \qquad m =(m_1,\cdots,m_M)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:3)
# 
# Just because $\varepsilon=y-f(m)$, we can see eq. {eq}`E:2` as the conditional probability denstity function (PDF) for the observations given the model parameters 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(y|m) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\,\pi)^N\,\det(C)}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{W(m)}{2}\right) 
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:4)
# 
# with $W$ being the so called weighted residual square sum (WRSS)
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & W(m) = (y-f(m))^T\,C^{-1}\,(y-f(m))
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:5)
# 
# ```
# 
# 
# <font size="4"> Homogeneous half-space model </font>
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Let us now consider the simple half-space homogeneous Earth models and denote with $c_p$ and $c_s$ being the velocities of the P and S waves, respectively, and the model parameters $m$ as the origin time $t_e$ and spatial coordinates $\mathbf{x}_e$
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & m=(t_e,\mathbf{x}_e)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:6)
# 
# In this case, the observation equation {eq}`E:1` can be further specified as follows
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & y_i = f_i(m) + \varepsilon_i  \qquad
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:7)
# 
# with
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & f_i(m) =  t_e + \frac{|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_e|}{c_i}
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:8)
# 
# Here, $y_i$ and $\varepsilon_i$ are the time and the random error of the $i$-th pickings, while $c_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$ are  the seismic velocity of its phase ($c_p$ or $c_s$) and the spatial coordinates of its seismic station. Furthermore, assuming that there are no modelling errors and that the observations are independent, the covariance $C$ of the random errors is a simple diagonal matrix
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & C = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1^2,\cdots,\sigma_N^2)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:9)
# 
# with the variances $\sigma_i^2$ as diagonal elements. Here, $\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of the $i$-th picking. 
# 
# We note that, in this simple case, the inverse of the covariance $C $ simply reads
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & C ^{-1} = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1^{-2},\cdots,\sigma_N^{-2})
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:10)
# 
# and the WRSS, eq. {eq}`E:5` simplifies into
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & W(m) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{y_i-f_i(m)}{\sigma_i}\right)^2
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:11)
# 
# Recasted in this form, we can understand that each term of the summation defining the WRSS is the residual square $(y_i-f_i(m))^2$ weighted by the variance $\sigma_i^2$.
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Posterior probability density function (PDF)
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# The posterior PDF is the conditional PDF $p(m|y)$ of the model parameters given the observaions. In order to obtain the posterior PDF, let us now assume that the prior information on the model parameters are described by the PDF $p(m)$ and make use of it for defining the PDF for both the observations and the model parameters
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(y,m) = p(y|m)\,p(m)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:12)
# 
# In this respect the prior information can be seen as the marginal PDF for the model parameters 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(m) =\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} p(y,m)\,d y = p(m)\,\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} p(y|m)\,d y  = p(m)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:13)
# 
# In order to obtain the posterior PDF $p(m|y)$, we rewrite eq. {eq}`E:12` with the roles of $y$ and $m$ reversed
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(y,m) = p(m|y)\,p(y)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:14)
# 
# with $p(y)$ being the marginal PDF for the observation
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(y) = \int_{\mathcal{M}} p(y,m)\,dm
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:15)
# 
# where $\mathcal{M}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^M$ is the model parameter space. The latter can be a subset of the M-dimensional space just because some model parameters can be constrained to some sepcific region of it, as for instance the vertical (or radial) coordinate of the origin that we assume to be non-positive (i.e., we will consider only positive depth, within the solid Earth).
# 
# From the comparison between eqs. {eq}`E:12` and {eq}`E:14`, we thus obtain the so called Bayes' theorem
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(m|y) = \frac{p(y|m)\,p(m)}{p(y)}
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:16)
# 
# We note that the denominator $p(y)$ of the right-hand side of eq. {eq}`E:16` is needed only for normalizing the posterior PDF and, so, we can write
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(m|y) \propto p(y|m)\,p(m)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:17)
# 
# Further assuming that we do not have prior information and that the prior PDF is constant, the Bayes' theorem simply states that the posterior PDF is simply proportional to the conditional PDF of the observations given the model parameters
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(m|y) \propto p(y|m)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:18)
# 
# ```
# 
# ### Additional weights
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# As we will see, the pickings from the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia are provided with both the uncertainties (i.e., their standard derivations $\sigma_i$) and additional weights $w_i$. This means that the WRSS, eq. {eq}`E:11` is actualy modified as follows
# 
# $$ 
# \begin{align}
# & \displaystyle
# W(m) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i\,\left(\frac{y_i-f_i(m)}{\sigma_i}\right)^2 
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:19)
# 
# where each weighted residual square is multiplied by the additional weight $w_i$. The use of additional weight is quite common in the earthquake localization because it allows to give more weights to the early pickings (i.e., to the pickings of those seismic stations closer to the earthquake origin). It easy to understand that their introduction is equivalent to scale the original standard deviations $\sigma_i$ by $w_i^{-1/2}$
# 
# $$ 
# \begin{align}
# & \displaystyle
# W(m) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{y_i-f_i(m)}{\sigma_i\,w_i^{-1/2}}\right)^2 
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:20)
# 
# In light of this and of eqs. {eq}`E:4` and {eq}`E:18`, we thus obtain
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & p(m|y) = k\,\exp\left(-\frac{W(m)}{2}\right)
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:21)
# 
# where $k$ is a normalization constant that we will not need to determine. 
# 
# Neglecting the differences between volumetric and density probability functions discussed in {numref}`Appendix %s - Inverse problem theory <chap-I>`, we can estimate the best (or most likelihood) model parameters by minimizing thw WRSS. In other words, the model parameteres $m^*$ that minimize $W$ will be our estimate of the origin time and spatial coordinates of the earthquake
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
#  W(m^*) = \min_{m\in\mathcal{M}} W(m) &
# \end{align}
# $$ (E:22)
# 
# ```

# ## Data set
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# 
# In this section we will obtain all the information that we need to define the inverse problem, which means that we will obtain the picking times and all the additional information that we need for implementing the theoretical relationship between the model parameters and the observations, as well as calculating the WRSS.

Also, we can see that all the arrivals for the S waves are weighted by about one half with respect to the arrivals for P waves at similar distances. This is beacuse the picking of the S waves is much more questionable than that of the P waves.

Unfortunatly, the geopgarphical coordinate are not ready available niether from the pick or the arrival and, so, we shall make use of the waveform identifiers contained in the picks along with an inventory of the seismic networks from which we can obtain the geographical coordinates.
