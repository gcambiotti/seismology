# 
# The (Richter or) local magnitude $M_L$ is defined as 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & M_L = \log_{10}\left(\frac{A}{\mathrm{m}}\right) + 6 + Z(r)
# \end{align}
# $$ (M:1)
# 
# where $A$ is the maximum amplitude on a Wood-Anderson seismogram (Anderson and Wood 1925), $r$ is the hypocentral distance and $Z$ is a distance correction that, according to Hutton and Boore (1996), reads 
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & Z(r) = a\,\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{100\,\mathrm{km}}\right) + b\,\left(\frac{r}{100\,\mathrm{km}}-1\right)  
# \end{align}
# $$ (M:2)
# 
# Here $a$ and $b$ are two constants accounting for the geometrical spreading and the anaelastic attenuation. For crustal earthquakes in regions with attenuative properties similar to those of Southern California, the values proposed by the [International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI)](http://iaspei.org/) are $a=1.110$ and $b=0.189$. We note that
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & Z(100\,\mathrm{km}) = 0
# \end{align}
# $$ (M:3)
# 
# In order to anchor this magnitude scale to some particular number, a magnitude $M_L=3$ earthquake at $100\,\mathrm{km}$ distance was defined to have maximum amplitude of $1\,\mathrm{mm}$ on the Wood-Anderson seismogram. Even better, we could say that  a magnitude $M_L=0$ earthquake at $100\,\mathrm{km}$ distance was defined to have maximum amplitude of $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ on the Wood-Anderson seismogram.
# 
# 
# The specific form of the distance correction function comes from the following simple model of the dependence of the displacement amplitude on the hypocentral distance, which accounts both for the geometrical spreading and for the anaelastic attenuation,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# & A \propto r^{-\gamma}\,e^{-\frac{\omega\,r}{2\,c_s\,Q_s(\omega)}}
# \end{align}
# $$ (M:4)
# 
# Here, $\gamma$ is the geometrical spreading (which shoulb be equal to $1$ for body waves and $1/2$ for surface waves), $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $c_s$ is the S-wave velocity (the maximum amplitude is often due to S-wave) and $Q_s$ is the (shear) quality factor (which is inversely proportional to the analeastic attenuation and can depend on the angular frequency). 
# 
# Thanks to this correction, as far as it is accurate, it does not matter how far the seismic station is from the hypocentre. Seismic stations at different distances should provide the same estimate of the magnitude.

# 
# ## The Wood-Andersoon seismometer
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# Although designed differently from a classical mechanical seismometer (i.e. a mass-spring-dash pot system), the Wood-Andersoon seismometer responds to ground motion as a driven harmonic oscillator but for an additional gain achieved through the optical system used for photographic recording.
# 
# The natural period $T_0$ and damping constant $\xi$ of the Wood-Andersoon seismometer are $T_0=0.8\,\mathrm{s}$ and $\xi=0.7$ and the nominal gain was $2800$. It has later been determined that the gain in reality was only $2080 \pm 60$ (Urhammer and Collins 1990), which is important, since local magnitude scales made today refer to the *theoretical* output of this seismograph.
# 
# 
# ```
# 
# 
# ```{note} 
# :class: full-width
# 
# We recall that the output of a Wood-Andersoon seismograph is not in counts but, recording displacements photographically, has the dimension of a length. It is indeed a pendulum type instrument  consisting of a metal cylinder tautly attached to an eccentric vertical suspension wire as shown in {numref}`Figure {number} <fig-wood-anderson>`. The cylinder will rotate around the wire and a mirror, attached to the mass, is used for photographic recording of the displacement. The damping of the mass rotation is achieved by a magnetic flux (from a magnet) normal to the mass motion. As the mass is conductive, the stray current induced opposes to motion and is proportional to the mass velocity. The suspension wire may also vibrate with string modes, but these are effectively damped mechanically by two oil drops in contact with the wire.

# The Wood Anderson torsion seismometer shown schematically.  The copper cylindrical mass is suspended on an eccentric taut wire and can rotate slightly.  A magnet (not fully drawn) is used for damping the mass rotation. The transverse vibration of the wire is damped by two drops of oil. The height of the instrument is 36 cm.
