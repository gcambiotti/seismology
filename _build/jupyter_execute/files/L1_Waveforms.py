# ### Preprocessing

# ```{div} full-width
# 
# In order to retrieve the ground motion from the raw data, first we have to make them suitable for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This means that we have to modify the traces so that they can be seen as periodic signals and that the operations of convolutions can be performed without wrap around effects.
# 
# In order to make periodic the data, first, we shall remove a long term trend for reducing the jump between the beginning and the end of the trace (using the method `stream.detrend` with `type="polynomial` we can fit a polynomial of given order to the data and remove it)
# 
# ```

# In[36]:


original_stream = stream.copy()
stream.detrend(type="polynomial", order=1);


# ```{div} full-width
# 
# Here, we have made a copy of the original `stream` before applying the `.detrend` method
# 
# Second, we shall apply a cosine taper for guaranting a smooth transition towards the same value (say zero) at the beginning and the end of the trace (using the method `stream.taper` with `type=cosine`). In this way the first and last samples of the trace will coincide and, so, there will be no issues concerning the artificial discontinuity when the the trace data will be seen as periodic. 
# ```

# In[37]:

    ax.axvspan(end-T, end,     alpha=0.2)


# ```{div} full-width
# 
# In the end, in order to make safe the operation of convolution, we shall add to the trace some zero samples after its end, long enough to prohibit wrap around effects during convolution. This last task can be accomplieshed by doubling the length of the trace and setting to zero all the added samples (using the method `trace.trim`). The exact final number of the sampling is custoraily decided in order to speed up the FFT calculations and can be obtained using the function `_npts2nfft` from the module `obspy.signal.util`

fig = lab.plot_fft(stream, extra_label="pre", fig=fig, alpha=0.5)


# ```{div} full-width
# 
# As we can see, especially for the accelerometer which is characterized by a strong linear trend, the spectrum of the preprocessed stream is smaller at low frequencies. Also, specially for the velocimeter, the spectrum of the preprocessed stream is smaller  at high frequency because we apply the cosine taper, thus removing the discontinuity between the end and the beginning of the timeseries.

# ### Response function
# 
# ```{div} full-width
# As already mentioned, what we have plotted so far are counts and so, in the following, we shall learn how to retrive the ground motion from them.

On the basis of the $\omega^2$-model we should expect flat spectral amplitudes in the low frequency range and, indeed, this is the case from 0.006 to 0.2 Hz for the velocimeter (HHZ) and from 0.02 to 0.2 Hz for the accelerometer (HNZ). Nevertheless, at lower frequencies, the spectral amplitudes increase. Also, at high frequency, we shall expect that the spectral amplitudes decrease with increasing frequencies and that this feature should be even more pronunced once scattering and analestic attenuation is considered. This occurs up to about 15 Hz although, at higer frequency, the decreases stop.

# ## Noise

# ```{div} full-width
# In order to understand the physical discrepancies about the spectral amplituded of the ground displacement, let us select a time window where no earthquake occurs by trimming the origial stream up to the origin time and performing the standard preprocessing and, then, retriving the ground displacement 

# In[60]:


noise = original_stream.copy()
missing = noise.attach_response(inventory)
noise.trim(endtime=origin.time)

# ```{div} full-width
# Then, we compare the spectral amplitude of the ground displacements in the noisy time window with those including the earthquake
